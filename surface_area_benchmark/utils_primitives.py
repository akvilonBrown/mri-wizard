'''
To create a sphere in a 3D numpy array with a given radius, you can use the equation of a sphere:
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2
Where x, y and z are the coordinates of each voxel in the array, and r is the radius of the sphere. 
You iterate over each voxel in the array, calculate its distance from the center of the sphere, and if the distance is less than or equal to the radius, 
you set the value of that voxel to 1, indicating that it is part of the sphere

Example usage:
radius = 5
shape = (20, 20, 20)
sphere = create_sphere(radius, shape)

This function create_sphere takes the radius of the sphere and the shape of the numpy array as input and returns a 3D numpy array 
representing the sphere with the specified radius. Note that this implementation is straightforward but not very efficient, especially for larger arrays and radii. 
Depending on your specific needs, you might want to explore more efficient algorithms like the midpoint circle algorithm adapted to 3D space.
