# Postprocessing and analysis

The postprocessing of segmented images is performed by several scripts, that run one after another, they are accordingly enumerated.
The input data consist of source and segmented images, grouped in folder according to probes/cultivar distribution. Number of images in folder are not limited, the distribution should be described in the Excel file. The demo data and description file are provided, these must be downloaded and placed in the **data** folder (check the preferable folder structure in the *README* under **data** folder). For the start of postprocessing it is enough. The demo data also contains the intermediate and final outputs for inspection - you can remove them to check how postprocessing scripts work step by step, and create the debug data in the progress, folliwing the setting in the **config** file.
